# Utility scripts (not required for RQ1–RQ3)

These are small helpers that are occasionally useful when working with the datasets or bookkeeping, but they are **not required** for reproducing the main RQ outputs.

- `00_counts_table.R`: quick per-site counts table for sanity-checking data support.
- `00_backfill_manifest_from_cmdstan.R`: reconstructs `reports/run_manifest.csv` from CmdStan CSV headers (for older runs).
